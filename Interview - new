how to check ram, cpu in linux?
You can check RAM and CPU information in Linux using several commands. Here are the most common ones:

🔍 Check RAM Usage
1. free -h
Displays total, used, and free memory in a human-readable format.

free -h
2. top or htop
Real-time memory (and CPU) usage.

top
htop is a better, interactive version (install using sudo apt install htop or sudo yum install htop).

3. cat /proc/meminfo
Shows detailed memory statistics.

cat /proc/meminfo
🧠 Check CPU Info
1. lscpu
Displays detailed CPU architecture info.

lscpu
2. cat /proc/cpuinfo
Lists all CPU cores and details.

cat /proc/cpuinfo
3. nproc
Shows number of processing units available.

nproc
4. top or htop
Shows CPU usage in real-time.

2) how to check ram and memory usage by services
To check RAM and memory usage by services or processes in Linux, here are the most effective ways:

✅ 1. top or htop (Recommended for Live Monitoring)
🔹 top
top
Press M (uppercase) to sort by memory usage.

Columns to look for:

%MEM: percentage of RAM used

RES: resident memory used

🔹 htop (nicer interface, shows services grouped)
htop
You may need to install it first:

sudo apt install htop     # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install htop     # RHEL/CentOS
✅ 2. ps Command (Script-Friendly)
🔹 Show Top Memory-Consuming Processes

ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 10
aux: list all processes

--sort=-%mem: sort by memory usage (descending)

🔹 Group memory usage by service name (approx.)

ps -eo pid,comm,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head -n 10
Shows PID, command, memory %, and CPU %

✅ 3. smem (Accurate Memory Accounting)
More detailed than ps (shows PSS – proportional set size).

sudo apt install smem     # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install smem     # RHEL/CentOS

smem -r | head
✅ 4. systemd-cgtop (For systemd-managed services)
If your system uses systemd, this tool shows real-time memory & CPU usage per systemd service.

sudo systemd-cgtop
Summary Table:
Command	Use Case
top / htop	Live process monitoring
ps aux --sort=-%mem	Quick top memory users
smem	Accurate memory per process
systemd-cgtop	Usage grouped by systemd services

3)listing zombie or deamon process
Process Type	How to List
Zombie	`ps aux
Daemon	`ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd

3)how to create users in linux and configure it
sudo adduser username
sudo passwd username
sudo usermod -aG sudo username 

4)how to provide permissions to user
🔹 Change ownership (user & group)
sudo chown username filename
sudo chown username:groupname filename
🔹 Create a group & add user
sudo groupadd devgroup
sudo usermod -aG devgroup username
🔹 Assign group ownership to a file/folder
sudo chown :devgroup /var/www/html

Task	Command
Change file owner	chown username file
Change file permissions	chmod 755 file
Add user to group	usermod -aG groupname username
Grant sudo access	usermod -aG sudo username
Restrict sudo to one command	visudo + specific command config

5) what if disk usage is full in linux
🔍 1. Check Disk Usage
Overall disk usage:
df -h
Look for partitions with 100% or high usage.

Disk usage by directory:
du -h --max-depth=1 / | sort -hr | head -n 10
Shows which folders use the most space (e.g., /var, /home, /tmp)

🧹 2. Clean Up Space
🔸 Delete log files (often the culprit)
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d       # Keep only 7 days of logs
sudo rm -rf /var/log/*.gz /var/log/*.1 /var/log/syslog.*
🔸 Remove orphaned packages & cache
sudo apt autoremove && sudo apt clean      # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum autoremove && sudo yum clean all  # RHEL/CentOS
🔸 Clean package cache
sudo du -sh /var/cache/apt     # Debian
sudo du -sh /var/cache/yum     # RHEL
🔸 Clear temporary files
sudo rm -rf /tmp/*
sudo rm -rf /var/tmp/*
🔸 Find and delete large files
sudo find / -type f -size +100M -exec ls -lh {} \;
Then review and delete:
sudo rm -f /path/to/largefile
🔄 3. Move Data to Another Disk (if needed)
Mount external disk or attach EBS volume (in cloud)

Move large files or logs to /mnt/newdisk or similar

Create symlinks if necessary:

ln -s /mnt/newdisk/bigfile /original/location/bigfile
🛡️ 4. Prevent Future Issues
Set log rotation (logrotate)

Monitor disk usage regularly (e.g., cron + df)

Use tools like:

ncdu — interactive disk usage analyzer

duf — disk usage with nicer UI

6)how to check on which port service is running
🔹 Show all listening ports:
ss -tuln
Show which service/process is using a port:
sudo ss -tulnp
sudo netstat -tulnp
sudo systemctl status nginx
 Example: Find what’s using port 8080
sudo lsof -i :8080
# OR
sudo ss -tulnp | grep 8080

7)proxy and reverse proxy
🔄 Proxy Server
Acts as an intermediary for client requests going outward to the internet or other networks.

The client connects to the proxy, and the proxy forwards the request to the target server.

Commonly used for:

Privacy/anonymity (client’s IP hidden)

Caching content for faster access

Access control and filtering (e.g., block certain sites)

Bypassing geo-restrictions

Diagram:
Client → Proxy Server → Internet / Target Server
Examples:
Squid proxy

HTTP Proxy, SOCKS Proxy

🔙 Reverse Proxy
Acts as an intermediary for server requests coming inward from clients.

The client connects to the reverse proxy, and the reverse proxy forwards the request to one or more backend servers.

Commonly used for:

Load balancing among multiple servers

SSL termination (handle HTTPS)

Caching responses to reduce backend load

Security — hide backend server details

Compression and request routing

Diagram:
Client → Reverse Proxy → Backend Servers
Examples:
Nginx (as reverse proxy)

HAProxy

Apache HTTP Server (with mod_proxy)

Summary Table
Aspect	Proxy	Reverse Proxy
Client role	Client initiates request	Client connects to reverse proxy
Direction	Forwards client → internet	Forwards client → backend servers
Purpose	Privacy, caching, filtering	Load balancing, security, SSL termination
IP seen by target	Proxy’s IP	Reverse proxy’s IP
Example use cases	Web browsing via proxy server	Serving web apps behind Nginx


The curl command is a powerful tool in Linux used to transfer data to or from a server using various protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.). It's commonly used for testing APIs, downloading files, and debugging network requests.

an application deployed in AWS ec2 not able to access the application using browser how to debug ?

🔹 1. Check if the Application is Running
SSH into the EC2 instance:
ssh ec2-user@<your-ec2-public-ip>
Then run:
ps aux | grep <your_app>
# OR
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep LISTEN
# OR
sudo ss -tulnp
✅ Make sure it's running and listening on the expected port (e.g., 80, 3000, 8080, etc.)

🔹 2. Check Application Bind Address
Your app should bind to 0.0.0.0, not 127.0.0.1 (localhost) to accept external traffic.

Fix example (Node.js):
app.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0');
🔹 3. Check EC2 Security Group
Go to EC2 Console → Instances → Security → Security Groups.

Ensure inbound rules allow traffic:

Type	Protocol	Port	Source
HTTP	TCP	80	0.0.0.0/0
HTTPS	TCP	443	0.0.0.0/0
Custom TCP	TCP	<Your App Port>	0.0.0.0/0

Add the necessary rules if missing.

🔹 4. Check EC2 Network ACLs and VPC
If you have a restrictive Network ACL, make sure inbound and outbound rules allow traffic on your port.

✅ Also verify the EC2 instance is in a public subnet with:

A route to an internet gateway

A public IP or Elastic IP assigned

7)what if docker image size is full
Check Image Sizes
docker images
Look at the SIZE column.

You’ll often find large images or unused tags.

🧹 2. Clean Up Unused Resources
🔸 Remove stopped containers:
docker container prune
🔸 Remove unused images (dangling or not used):
docker image prune
To remove all unused images:

docker image prune -a
🔸 Remove unused volumes:

docker volume prune
🔸 Remove unused networks:

docker network prune
🔸 Remove everything unused:

docker system prune -a
⚠️ This will remove all stopped containers, dangling images, networks, and volumes not used by any container.

🔍 3. Analyze What’s Taking Up Space

docker system df
This shows how much disk space is used by:

Images
Containers
Volumes
Build cache

🔧 4. Reduce Docker Image Size (for Developers)
If you're building your own image, optimize it:

Use slim base images:
e.g., python:3.11-slim, node:alpine, debian:bookworm-slim

Multi-stage builds:
Only copy needed binaries/artifacts in the final image.

Clean up apt/pip/npm/yum cache during install:
Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ... && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
Avoid copying unnecessary files:
Use .dockerignore like .gitignore

🚨 5. If Disk Is Already Full
Delete unused images manually:

docker rmi <image_id>
Stop Docker and manually delete:

sudo systemctl stop docker
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
⚠️ This deletes everything Docker-related. Only use if you're okay with a full reset.

🛑 Final Tips
Use watch docker system df to monitor usage over time.
Set up CI/CD pipelines to use optimized images.
Use docker save and docker load for moving images between systems without rebuilding.
