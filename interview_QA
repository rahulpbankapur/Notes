1) what is DNS mapping and why it is used and explain with detailed explanation and live example??

What is DNS Mapping?
DNS Mapping refers to the process of associating domain names (human-readable website addresses like www.example.com) with their corresponding IP addresses (numerical addresses like 192.168.1.1) to make internet navigation user-friendly.

When a user enters a domain name in their browser, DNS maps that domain to its IP address, enabling communication between the userâ€™s device and the server hosting the content.

Why is DNS Mapping Used?
Human-Friendly Navigation:

IP addresses are difficult to remember, whereas domain names are easier for humans.
Abstraction:

Abstracts the complexity of underlying IP addresses from users.
Scalability:

Supports the dynamic association of domain names to changing IP addresses, which is crucial in scalable systems (e.g., cloud environments).
Load Balancing:

DNS mapping can route traffic to multiple IP addresses for better performance and availability.
Flexibility:

Makes it easy to move services between different servers or update configurations without disrupting the user experience.
How Does DNS Mapping Work?
Domain Name:
A domain like www.example.com is registered with a domain registrar.
DNS Records:
DNS records are created to define how the domain maps to the server.
DNS Lookup:
When a user types a URL into their browser, the following steps occur:
The browser queries the local DNS resolver.
If the resolver doesn't have the mapping, it queries external DNS servers (e.g., root, TLD, and authoritative DNS servers).
The IP address is returned and cached for future use.
Connection to the Server:
The browser uses the returned IP address to connect to the server.
Types of DNS Records in Mapping
A Record:

Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
Example: www.example.com â†’ 192.168.1.1
AAAA Record:

Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
Example: www.example.com â†’ 2001:db8::ff00:42:8329
CNAME Record:

Maps a domain name to another domain name (aliasing).
Example: blog.example.com â†’ www.example.com
MX Record:

Maps a domain to a mail server.
Example: example.com â†’ mail.example.com
NS Record:

Defines the authoritative DNS servers for the domain.
Example: example.com â†’ ns1.example.com
TXT Record:

Stores arbitrary text, often used for verification (e.g., SPF, DKIM).
Live Example of DNS Mapping
Scenario: Hosting a Website Using DNS Mapping
Register a Domain:

Register www.mywebsite.com with a domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy).
Host the Website:

Deploy the website on a server with an IP address: 203.0.113.10.
Set Up DNS Records:

Access the domain's DNS settings and configure the following:
A Record:
yaml
Copy
Edit
Type: A
Host: @
Points to: 203.0.113.10
TTL: 3600
CNAME Record:
yaml
Copy
Edit
Type: CNAME
Host: www
Points to: @
TTL: 3600
DNS Propagation:

Changes may take a few hours to propagate across DNS servers globally.
Testing:

Open a browser and type www.mywebsite.com.
The browser queries DNS, resolves www.mywebsite.com to 203.0.113.10, and connects to the server to load the website.
Advanced Example: Using DNS for Load Balancing
Scenario: Traffic Distribution Across Multiple Servers
Set Up Multiple Servers:

Host the application on two servers:
Server 1: 203.0.113.10
Server 2: 203.0.113.11
DNS Configuration:

Create multiple A Records for the domain:
vbnet
Copy
Edit
Type: A
Host: @
Points to: 203.0.113.10
TTL: 60
vbnet
Copy
Edit
Type: A
Host: @
Points to: 203.0.113.11
TTL: 60
DNS Round-Robin:

DNS servers alternate between IPs (203.0.113.10 and 203.0.113.11), distributing user traffic across both servers.
Testing:

Use tools like nslookup or dig to verify DNS resolution:
bash
Copy
Edit
nslookup www.mywebsite.com
Result:

Users are routed to either server, balancing the load.
Tools for DNS Management and Testing
Tools for Management:

Cloudflare: Simplified DNS management.

how AWS codebuild can be triggered in AWS for building the code?

Ways to Trigger AWS CodeBuild
Manual Trigger

You can manually start a CodeBuild project from the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDK.
Steps in the Console:
Navigate to the CodeBuild console.
Select the desired project.
Click Start build.
Configure the build input (source code location, environment variables, etc.).
Start the build.
Trigger Using AWS CodePipeline

CodeBuild is commonly used as part of a CI/CD pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.
CodePipeline automatically triggers CodeBuild when there is a change in the source (e.g., a commit in a Git repository).
Steps:
Create a CodePipeline with the following stages:
Source Stage:
Use AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, S3, or other supported sources.
Build Stage:
Add CodeBuild as the build provider and configure the CodeBuild project.
Commit changes to the source repository (e.g., GitHub or CodeCommit).
CodePipeline will automatically trigger CodeBuild when changes are detected.

Trigger Using Webhooks

CodeBuild can be triggered by webhooks for GitHub, Bitbucket, or CodeCommit repositories.
Steps:
Configure Webhook in CodeBuild:
In the CodeBuild project, select a source repository like GitHub or CodeCommit.
Enable the Webhook option.
Test Webhook Trigger:
Push a change to the branch connected to CodeBuild.
The webhook automatically triggers the build process.
Trigger Using AWS CLI

You can trigger CodeBuild using the AWS CLI for scripting or custom workflows.
Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
aws codebuild start-build --project-name my-codebuild-project
Replace my-codebuild-project with the name of your CodeBuild project.
Trigger Using AWS Lambda

You can use AWS Lambda to trigger CodeBuild programmatically in response to custom events.
Steps:
Create a Lambda Function:
Write a Lambda function that starts a CodeBuild project using the AWS SDK.
Example:
python
Copy
Edit
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    client = boto3.client('codebuild')
    response = client.start_build(projectName='my-codebuild-project')
    return response
Set up the Event Source:
Link the Lambda function to an event source like S3, SNS, or EventBridge.
Test the Setup:
Trigger the event and observe that the Lambda function starts a build.
Trigger Using GitHub Actions

Use GitHub Actions to trigger AWS CodeBuild as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
Steps:
Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:
Example build.yml:
yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Trigger CodeBuild

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger AWS CodeBuild
        run: |
          aws codebuild start-build --project-name my-codebuild-project
Configure AWS Credentials:
Set up AWS credentials in the GitHub Actions secrets.

explain with detailed explaination and example how codebuild is triggered using codepipeline and webhook?

1. Triggering CodeBuild Using CodePipeline
Overview
AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed CI/CD service that automates the software release process. It integrates with CodeBuild as a build stage. CodePipeline triggers CodeBuild when a change is detected in the source repository (e.g., CodeCommit, GitHub, or Bitbucket).

Steps to Configure CodePipeline with CodeBuild
Weâ€™ll set up a CodePipeline that:

Monitors a GitHub repository for changes using a webhook.
Triggers CodeBuild to compile and test the code.
Deploys the build artifact to an S3 bucket.
Step-by-Step Process
Step 1: Prerequisites
AWS CLI: Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured.
IAM Roles:
Create a role for CodePipeline with permissions to:
Access the source repository.
Trigger CodeBuild.
Create a role for CodeBuild with permissions to:
Pull source code.
Write build artifacts to an S3 bucket.
GitHub Repository:
Have a repository with some sample code and a buildspec.yml file.
Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket for Artifacts
Create an S3 bucket to store the build artifacts:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3 mb s3://my-codepipeline-artifacts
Step 3: Create a CodeBuild Project
Go to the AWS CodeBuild Console.
Click Create Build Project and configure:
Source:
Select GitHub and authenticate.
Choose the repository and branch.
Buildspec:
Use a buildspec.yml file stored in the repository.
Example buildspec.yml:
yaml
Copy
Edit
version: 0.2
phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 16
    commands:
      - echo "Installing dependencies"
      - npm install
  build:
    commands:
      - echo "Building the project"
      - npm run build
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo "Build completed"
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
Artifacts:
Store artifacts in the previously created S3 bucket.
Step 4: Create a CodePipeline
Go to the AWS CodePipeline Console.

Click Create Pipeline and configure:

Pipeline Settings:
Name: my-codepipeline
Artifact Store: Use the S3 bucket you created earlier.
Source Stage:
Provider: GitHub.
Repository: Select the repository.
Branch: Choose the branch to monitor.
Enable Webhook: This ensures CodePipeline triggers when thereâ€™s a change in the repository.
Build Stage:
Provider: CodeBuild.
Select the CodeBuild project you created earlier.
Deploy Stage (Optional):
You can add a deploy stage to push artifacts to an environment.
Save and start the pipeline.

How It Works
Webhook Creation:

When you enable the webhook in CodePipeline, AWS automatically creates a webhook in your GitHub repository.
Any push event to the monitored branch triggers the webhook, notifying CodePipeline.
CodePipeline Triggers CodeBuild:

CodePipeline starts when it receives a webhook notification.
It retrieves the source code, packages it, and sends it to CodeBuild.
CodeBuild Executes Build Steps:

CodeBuild uses the buildspec.yml file to execute build instructions.
Build artifacts are stored in the specified S3 bucket.
Example: Webhook in Action
Push Code Changes:

Make a change in your local repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "New feature added" >> feature.txt
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Added a new feature"
git push origin main
Webhook Notification:

The webhook sends a notification to CodePipeline about the change.
Pipeline Execution:

CodePipeline retrieves the latest code and triggers CodeBuild.
Build Completion:

CodeBuild executes the build, stores the output in the S3 bucket, and updates the pipeline.
Check Status:

Open the CodePipeline Console to verify the pipeline stages.
Open the CodeBuild Console to view the build logs.
Step-by-Step Example
1. GitHub Repository:
Repository: my-repo
Branch: main
Includes buildspec.yml.
2. CodePipeline:
Source: GitHub repository with webhook enabled.
Build: CodeBuild project for compiling code.
Artifacts: Stored in S3.
3. Workflow in Action:
Push changes to main branch:
bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
Pipeline starts automatically via the webhook.
4. Outputs:
Logs: Check build logs in the CodeBuild Console.
Artifacts: Validate the output in the S3 bucket.
Benefits of Using CodePipeline with Webhooks
Automation: No manual intervention required for triggering builds.
Speed: Immediate builds after code changes.
Scalability: Integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like CodeDeploy.
Efficiency: Reduces errors with automated processes.
