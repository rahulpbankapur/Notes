ðŸ“˜ Basic TAC Questions and Answers
âœ… 1. What is TAC?
Answer:
TAC stands for Technical Assistance Center. It is a support service provided by technology companies (e.g., Cisco, Juniper, Dell, etc.) to help customers troubleshoot technical problems with their products.
TAC engineers handle:

Technical issues

Escalations

Software/hardware diagnostics

Bug reporting and patching

âœ… 2. What are the common tasks of a TAC engineer?
Answer:

Analyzing customer tickets and issues

Providing step-by-step troubleshooting

Escalating bugs to R&D if needed

Creating knowledge base articles

Monitoring ticket status in tools like Jira, ServiceNow, or Salesforce

âœ… 3. What tools are commonly used in TAC?
Answer:

Ticketing tools: Jira, ServiceNow, Zendesk, Salesforce

Remote tools: SSH, RDP, TeamViewer, AnyDesk

Monitoring tools: Nagios, Zabbix, SolarWinds

Network tools: Wireshark, traceroute, ping, netstat, telnet

âœ… 4. What are the basic steps for troubleshooting a customer issue?
Answer:

Understand and confirm the issue (read ticket carefully).

Collect logs, configurations, or screenshots.

Reproduce the issue (if possible).

Analyze data (logs, system state, versions).

Provide resolution or workaround.

If unresolved, escalate to higher support tier or engineering.

âœ… 5. How do you handle high-priority (P1) or escalation tickets?
Answer:

Acknowledge the ticket immediately.

Set up a call or remote session ASAP.

Keep clear and regular communication with the customer.

Work collaboratively with other internal teams (e.g., DevOps or Engineering).

Document everything and update the ticket until resolved.

âœ… 6. What is the difference between L1, L2, and L3 support in TAC?
Answer:

L1 (Tier 1): Basic troubleshooting, ticket triage, password resets.

L2 (Tier 2): Deeper technical expertise, product-level troubleshooting, log analysis.

L3 (Tier 3): Escalations, complex bugs, handled by developers or specialists.

âœ… 7. What should you do if you donâ€™t know the answer to a customerâ€™s problem?
Answer:

Acknowledge the customer and let them know youâ€™re investigating.

Gather more information.

Check internal knowledge bases or escalate to L2/L3.

Never guess or give incorrect advice.

âœ… 8. What is meant by RCA in TAC?
Answer:
RCA = Root Cause Analysis
Itâ€™s a detailed investigation to determine the underlying cause of a problem after itâ€™s resolved.
It includes:

Description of the issue

Steps taken to resolve

Logs and findings

Final root cause

Preventive recommendations

Here are more advanced and complex TAC (Technical Assistance Center) interview-style questions with detailed answers, focused on networking, protocols, escalation handling, and troubleshooting â€” suitable for L2/L3 or experienced TAC roles.

ðŸ”§ Advanced TAC Interview Questions and Answers
âœ… 1. How do you troubleshoot intermittent packet loss in a network?
Answer:

Check interface statistics on routers/switches for errors, CRCs, drops.

Use ping with large packet sizes and TTL to identify where loss begins.

Traceroute to map out the path and pinpoint the hop with delays/loss.

Check CPU/memory utilization on devices.

Examine logs (syslog, SNMP traps) for congestion or flapping interfaces.

If on wireless, inspect SNR and interference levels.

Use packet capture (Wireshark) if needed.

âœ… 2. What steps would you take for a high-severity P1 escalation involving a production outage?
Answer:

Acknowledge ticket immediately (SLA critical).

Get on a bridge call with stakeholders.

Collect initial information: impact scope, topology, recent changes.

Perform quick diagnostics (ping, port status, logs).

Roll back recent changes if outage is change-induced.

Involve senior engineers or L3 if root cause is unclear.

Provide timely updates and begin RCA documentation.

âœ… 3. What is the difference between a broadcast domain and a collision domain?
Answer:

Broadcast Domain: All devices that receive broadcast frames. Controlled by routers or VLANs.

Collision Domain: Where data packets can collide. Affects legacy hubs or half-duplex links.

Switches segment collision domains, but not broadcast domains unless VLANs are used.

âœ… 4. Describe how DNS resolution works and what youâ€™d check if DNS is failing.
Answer:

DNS query sent to local resolver (usually ISP or internal DNS).

If cache miss â†’ query root server â†’ TLD â†’ authoritative server.

IP returned to client.

Troubleshooting DNS failure:

Check if DNS server is reachable (nslookup, dig).

Validate DNS server IP in client configuration.

Inspect firewall or port blocks (UDP/53, TCP/53).

Look for DNS spoofing or redirection.

âœ… 5. Whatâ€™s the difference between STP and RSTP? How do you troubleshoot STP issues?
Answer:

STP (Spanning Tree Protocol): Prevents loops by blocking redundant paths.

RSTP (Rapid STP): Faster convergence (seconds vs 30+ sec for STP).

To troubleshoot:

Identify root bridge with show spanning-tree.

Look for TCA (Topology Change Acknowledgments) or frequent topology changes.

Check port states (Blocking, Forwarding).

Investigate any BPDU filtering/guard issues.

âœ… 6. A customer reports slow application performance over the VPN. How do you proceed?
Answer:

Verify if issue is application-specific or general.

Check latency and packet loss over VPN tunnel (ping, traceroute).

Inspect VPN tunnel status and encryption overhead (CPU usage).

Analyze throughput on both ends (interface stats).

Check for MTU or fragmentation issues.

Validate bandwidth utilization and QoS config.

Look into DNS or route-based misconfigurations.

âœ… 7. What causes asymmetric routing and how do you detect it?
Answer:
Asymmetric routing occurs when outbound and inbound traffic take different paths.

Detection:

Compare traceroute from both ends.

Use tcpdump or Wireshark to inspect TTL and source IPs.

Can cause issues with stateful firewalls, since return path doesn't match.

âœ… 8. What is a memory leak and how can it affect network appliances?
Answer:

A memory leak is when memory isnâ€™t released after use.

In routers/firewalls, it causes:

Performance degradation

Process crashes

Full memory utilization â†’ system reboot or failover

Use tools like top, show memory, or SNMP graphs to monitor.

âœ… 9. Explain how a firewall processes packets and what logs you would analyze during a connectivity issue.
Answer:

Firewalls process packets based on:

Access rules (ACLs)

NAT rules

Stateful inspection

Zones/policies

Troubleshooting:

Check deny logs for blocked packets.

Validate NAT translations.

Inspect session tables (show conn, show session).

Look for dropped connections or high CPU.

âœ… 10. A network interface is flapping every 10 seconds. What do you check?
Answer:

Physical layer: check cable, port, and transceiver (SFP/GBIC).

Port config mismatch (speed/duplex).

Errors in logs: CRCs, link-down messages.

Loop in the network? Check STP state.

Power issues on switch/router.

Environmental issues (heat, vibration).
